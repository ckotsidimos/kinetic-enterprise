# The Kinetic Enterprise

This repository contains doctrinal material related to enterprise operating models under conditions of speed, complexity, and capital pressure.

The central thesis is that modern enterprises fail not due to talent or tooling, but due to organizational physics: latency, coupling, and misaligned feedback loops.

This work is intended for CTOs, CIOs, and board-adjacent leaders operating inside large, regulated, or legacy organizations.

It is not a methodology.
It is not a transformation playbook.
It is a doctrine.

Current version: v2.1
