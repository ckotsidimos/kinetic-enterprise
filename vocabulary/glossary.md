# Glossary — The Kinetic Enterprise

This glossary defines the canonical vocabulary of  
THE KINETIC ENTERPRISE — A CTO Doctrine for the Cognitive Economy.

These terms are not metaphors.
They describe structural and physical properties of organizations.

Where conventional management language obscures causality,
this vocabulary exists to restore precision.

## Core Concepts

### Kinetic Enterprise
An organization capable of converting insight into authorized action
at the speed required by its environment, without destabilizing itself.

### Structural Lag
The delay introduced when an organization’s operating model
cannot move at the speed at which it can perceive reality.

### Insight–Action Gap
The time and friction between recognizing a signal
and executing a response that is permitted by governance.

### Organizational Physics
The principle that enterprises are constrained by structural properties
(latency, coupling, mass), not by intent, culture, or talent.

### Kinetic Governance
A form of governance that bounds action through interfaces and contracts
rather than prescribing behavior.

---

## Organizational Physics

### Mass
Accumulated coupling in systems, teams, processes, and governance
that increases the cost of change.

### Velocity
The speed at which an organization can execute meaningful change
once a decision is made.

### Momentum
The combined effect of Mass and Velocity.
High mass with low velocity creates fragility, not safety.

### Coupling
The degree to which change in one component
forces change in others.

### Inertia
Resistance to change created by accumulated mass and coupling,
independent of leadership intent.

## Governance & Control

### Governance
The mechanism by which risk is bounded.
Not the mechanism by which behavior is prescribed.

### Behavioral Governance
Governance that controls *how* work is done.
Effective in industrial systems. Limiting in cognitive systems.

### Interface Governance
Governance that controls *how systems and decisions connect*,
while leaving internal behavior autonomous.

### Decision Rights
Explicit authorization to act within a bounded context
without escalation.

### Control Surface
The point at which governance interacts with execution.

---

## Decision & Execution

### Decision Latency
The time between identifying a need to act
and receiving permission to act.

### Orientation
A shared understanding of intent, constraints, and direction
that enables decentralized decision-making.

### Intent
The desired outcome and boundaries of action,
not a list of prescribed tasks.

### Authorization
Structural permission to act,
not personal trust or seniority.

---

## Structural Patterns

### Mosaic
An organizational structure composed of semi-autonomous units
that can evolve independently without destabilizing the whole.

### Interface
A formal contract defining how systems, teams, or decisions interact,
independent of internal implementation.

---

## Anti-Patterns

### Cargo-Cult Agility
Adopting agile rituals without changing structural interfaces
or governance mechanics.

### Governance Drag
When risk controls introduce more delay
than the risk they are meant to mitigate.

### Permission-Seeking Organization
An organization where escalation replaces judgment
as the default response to uncertainty.

### Dashboard Illusion
The belief that visibility equals control,
even when action is structurally constrained.

## Closing Note

This glossary is a living artifact.
Terms may evolve, but meanings are versioned.

If a term is not defined here,
it is not part of the doctrine.
