# Versioning

## Purpose

This document defines how *The Kinetic Enterprise* doctrine versions over time.

Versioning exists to preserve:
- intellectual integrity
- citation stability
- reader trust

---

## Version Scheme

The doctrine follows **semantic doctrine versioning**:

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

- **MAJOR** — doctrinal shifts  
  (changes to core laws, models, or foundational assumptions)

- **MINOR** — structural or explanatory expansion  
  (new chapters, clarified models, extensions)

- **PATCH** — editorial refinement  
  (language, diagrams, examples, corrections)

Example:
- v2.1 → clarified doctrine
- v3.0 → new operating logic introduced

---

## Stability Promise

- PATCH releases do not change meaning
- MINOR releases do not invalidate prior conclusions
- MAJOR releases explicitly supersede earlier doctrine

This doctrine is *living*, but not *fluid*.
