# Kinetic Enterprise — Operating Doctrine

This folder contains the **core doctrines** underlying  
**THE KINETIC ENTERPRISE — A CTO Doctrine for the Cognitive Economy**.

These are **conceptual frameworks**, not implementation guides.

They describe *how modern organizations absorb change*,  
not how to run tools, teams, or projects.
