# Core Books & Practitioner Lineage

This bibliography documents the **intellectual lineage** behind  
**THE KINETIC ENTERPRISE — A CTO Doctrine for the Cognitive Economy**.

It is **acknowledgement**, not dependency.  
Many of these ideas were arrived at independently and later recognized as part of an existing body of work.

## Systems Theory, Flow & Constraint

Foundational thinking on systems behavior, limits, and unintended consequences.

- Goldratt, E. — *The Goal*
- Goldratt, E. — *Critical Chain*
- Meadows, D. — *Thinking in Systems*
- Ackoff, R. — *Re-Creating the Corporation*
- Forrester, J. — *Industrial Dynamics*
- Senge, P. — *The Fifth Discipline*

**Relevance**  
Defines why local optimization, over-control, and rigid structures fail under complexity and speed.

---

## Software, Flow & Organizational Physics

Where systems theory meets modern technology organizations.

- Kim, Behr, Spafford — *The Phoenix Project*
- Kim et al. — *The DevOps Handbook*
- Kersten, M. — *Project to Product*
- Forsgren, Humble, Kim — *Accelerate*
- Reinertsen, D. — *The Principles of Product Development Flow*

**Relevance**  
Establishes flow as the real unit of performance and exposes the cost of decision latency.

---

## Enterprise Architecture & Structure

Often misapplied, but foundational when treated as **structural design**, not governance theater.

- Ross, Weill, Robertson — *Enterprise Architecture as Strategy*
- Zachman, J. — *The Zachman Framework* (conceptual influence, not prescription)
- Mintzberg, H. — *Structure in Fives*
- Galbraith, J. — *Designing Organizations*

**Relevance**  
Provides the language for structure, boundaries, interfaces, and operating models.

---

## Organizational Design & Team Topology

How structure shapes behavior—whether intended or not.

- Skelton & Pais — *Team Topologies*
- Conway, M. — *How Do Committees Invent?*
- Dunbar, R. — *Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language*

**Relevance**  
Supports the doctrine’s emphasis on **interfaces over behavior** and bounded autonomy.

---

## Strategy & Competitive Dynamics

Why speed, adaptability, and positioning matter more than optimization.

- Porter, M. — *Competitive Strategy*
- Rumelt, R. — *Good Strategy / Bad Strategy*
- Christensen, C. — *The Innovator’s Dilemma*
- McGrath, R. — *The End of Competitive Advantage*

**Relevance**  
Explains why incumbents freeze and why static advantage decays under acceleration.

---

## Military, Maneuver & Decision Theory

The deepest lineage behind the doctrine’s motion logic.

- Boyd, J. — *Patterns of Conflict*
- Boyd, J. — *Organic Design for Command and Control*
- Lind et al. — *The Maneuver Warfare Handbook*
- Vego, M. — *Joint Operational Warfare*
- DARPA / CSBA — *Mosaic Warfare* (conceptual lineage)

**Relevance**  
Provides maneuver logic, decision-tempo focus, and distributed control principles transposed into enterprise systems.

---

## Governance, Risk & Control (Implicit Lineage)

Not cited directly, but critically reacted against.

- ITIL (as an operational control paradigm)
- COBIT (as a risk-control framework)
- Traditional PMO literature

**Relevance**  
Defines the failure mode the doctrine corrects—governance optimized for safety, not motion.

## Notes on Use

- This is **not** an academic thesis bibliography.
- These works are cited to **honor lineage**, not to outsource thinking.
- The doctrine stands on synthesis, not quotation.
