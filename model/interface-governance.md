# Interface Governance

Interface Governance defines **what is governed** in a high-speed enterprise.

The critical distinction is not how much governance exists, but **where it is applied**.

## Two Governance Logics

### Behavior Governance (Industrial Logic)

- Standardizes how work is done
- Enforces compliance through prescribed steps
- Audits human behavior
- Centralizes approval

This logic suppresses variance and maximizes predictability.

### Interface Governance (Kinetic Logic)

- Standardizes how systems, teams, and decisions connect
- Enforces constraints at boundaries
- Audits outcomes and contracts
- Enables local autonomy

This logic bounds risk while preserving motion.

## Interfaces Defined

An interface is a **formal boundary** governing interaction between autonomous units.

Interfaces may include:
- technical contracts
- decision rights
- funding boundaries
- risk limits
- escalation protocols

Behavior inside the boundary is autonomous.  
Compliance is enforced at the boundary.

## The Control Inversion

Control shifts from:
> preventing action  
to  
> bounding action

Risk does not disappear.  
It becomes **explicit, localized, and contained**.

Interface Governance is the structural prerequisite for maneuver.
