# Decision Latency

**Decision Latency** is the elapsed time between insight and authorized action.

It is the primary limiting factor of enterprise speed.

Most organizations focus on execution speed. This is a category error.  
In modern enterprises, execution is rarely slow — authorization is.

## The Latency Decomposition

Decision Latency consists of three components:

1. **Signal Latency**  
   Time required to detect a condition or change  
   (often milliseconds in modern systems)

2. **Authorization Latency**  
   Time required to obtain permission to act  
   (often weeks due to governance escalation)

3. **Action Latency**  
   Time required to implement and deploy  
   (often hours or days with modern tooling)

Enterprises optimized Signal Latency and Execution Latency while leaving Authorization Latency untouched.

## The Structural Cause

Authorization latency is not caused by:
- poor leadership
- risk aversion
- culture

It is caused by **structural centralization of decision rights**.

When decisions must travel upward for approval and downward for execution, time expands geometrically with scale.

## The Visibility Trap

Dashboards increase awareness without increasing motion.

As insight velocity increases faster than decision velocity:
- executive anxiety rises
- governance density increases
- paralysis accelerates

Decision Latency compounds under visibility.
