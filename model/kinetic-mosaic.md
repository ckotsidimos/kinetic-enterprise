# The Kinetic Mosaic

The **Kinetic Mosaic** is the structural form of an enterprise optimized for motion.

It replaces centralized coherence with **distributed coherence**.

## Tiles, Not Layers

A Mosaic Enterprise is composed of semi-autonomous tiles.

Each tile:
- owns outcomes
- operates within explicit interfaces
- can be modified without destabilizing the whole

This is not decentralization for its own sake.
It is **containment of change**.

## Structural Properties

A Mosaic exhibits:

- **Replaceability** — tiles can be evolved independently
- **Failure Containment** — errors do not cascade system-wide
- **Local Optimization** — decisions occur closest to reality
- **Global Coherence** — alignment is enforced at interfaces

## Why Mosaics Outperform Monoliths

Monoliths scale efficiency.
Mosaics scale adaptability.

Under speed:
- monoliths accumulate coupling
- mosaics absorb variance

The Mosaic does not eliminate coordination.
It eliminates **forced synchronization**.
