# Mission Command

Mission Command defines **how authority operates under speed**.

It replaces instruction-based control with intent-based autonomy.

## Authority Under Constraint

In high-speed environments, centralized control collapses under latency.

Mission Command resolves this by separating:
- **intent** (what must be achieved)
- **execution** (how it is achieved)

Authority is delegated to the point of action.

## Enterprise Interpretation

In an enterprise context, Mission Command means:

- leadership defines outcomes, boundaries, and priorities
- teams decide methods within those bounds
- escalation is the exception, not the default

Compliance does not disappear.
It is encoded in interfaces and constraints.

## Why This Sustains Maneuver

Mission Command:
- preserves speed without chaos
- enables local adaptation
- prevents decision bottlenecks

Without Mission Command, Mosaic structures collapse into coordination debt.

Mission Command is not a leadership style.
It is an **authority architecture**.
