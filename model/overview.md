# The Kinetic Operating Model

The **Kinetic Operating Model** defines how an enterprise maintains coherence while operating at speed under uncertainty.

It replaces stability-optimized structures with motion-optimized ones, without sacrificing control, compliance, or strategic intent.

This model is not a framework, method, or transformation approach.  
It is a **structural operating logic** for organizations whose environment changes faster than centralized decision-making can respond.

## Core Properties

A Kinetic Enterprise exhibits five non-negotiable properties:

- **Low Decision Latency** — insight converts to authorized action without escalation
- **Bounded Autonomy** — teams act independently within explicit constraints
- **Interface Governance** — control is enforced at boundaries, not behaviors
- **Mosaic Structure** — the system absorbs change locally without systemic shock
- **Intent-Based Command** — direction is expressed as outcomes, not instructions

## Model Components

This operating model is composed of four tightly coupled elements:

- **Decision Latency** — the dominant constraint on enterprise speed
- **Interface Governance** — the inversion that enables control without paralysis
- **Kinetic Mosaic** — the structural form that localizes change
- **Mission Command** — the authority model that sustains maneuver

These elements function together. Optimizing one in isolation collapses the system.

The model is designed to be read non-linearly.
