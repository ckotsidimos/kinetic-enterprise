# The Capability Maneuver Loop

## Doctrine Statement

**The Capability Maneuver Loop** is a continuous model for enterprise adaptation.

It describes how an organization senses change, reorients, assembles capability,
and reconfigures itself **without triggering enterprise-wide transformation programs**.

It replaces episodic change with permanent maneuver.

---

## The Law

> **Change is absorbed through capability, not projects.**  
> Enterprises that require transformation programs to adapt are already too slow.

---

## The Problem This Solves

Most enterprises respond to change using a **project mindset**:

- Observe change in the market
- Decide to “do a transformation”
- Launch a multi-year program
- Freeze architecture, funding, and teams
- Deliver too late
- Repeat

This creates **organizational latency**.

The Capability Maneuver Loop replaces this with a **continuous, low-friction mechanism**
for adaptation that operates inside the normal flow of the organization.

## The Capability Maneuver Loop

The loop consists of five tightly coupled phases:

### 1. Observe — Sense Change
Signals emerge from:
- Market shifts
- Customer behavior
- Regulatory pressure
- Technological discontinuities
- AI-driven variance and anomaly

Observation is **continuous**, not periodic.

---

### 2. Orient — Interpret Meaning
The organization interprets signals to answer one question:

> *“Do we need to build or evolve a capability?”*

Orientation is strategic, not technical.
It defines **intent**, not solutions.

---

### 3. Decide — Commit to Capability
The decision is not:
- “Launch a project”
- “Adopt a tool”
- “Run a transformation”

The decision is:

> **“We will build / evolve this capability.”**

This commits:
- intent
- funding
- boundaries
- accountability

—not implementation details.

---

### 4. Act (I) — Assemble the Mosaic Team
A **temporary, purpose-built capability team** is assembled.

Characteristics:
- Cross-functional
- Outcome-owned
